cordova-create-gui
==================

GUI for Cordova to create new projects

- Add the two plugins in **src/ios** into Xcode
- Add the appropriate entries in **config.xml** to your project's config.xml
- Use the code in index.html (note that it uses cordova-2.6.0.js)
- This **requires** the latest **cordova-osx** code as of April 15th, 2013.

**Cordova Path** - this is the root folder of your downloaded Cordova platform. 
It will use this folder to find the "bin/create" script. This path is saved in between launches.
